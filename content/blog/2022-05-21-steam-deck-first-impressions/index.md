It's been about two days since I received my Steam Deck, and after a few hours
of playing with it, I wanted to write up my very first impressions and thoughts
on it. There are tons of professional reviews of it online, but I figured it
might be useful if you are impatiently anticipating receiving your own unit and
want to know what to expect (or, if you are Valve and you want to get some data
points from the eyes of a new user).

I have a more detailed conclusion of my thoughts later on, but in a nutshell,
I'm very excited for what the Deck has to offer.

<!-- more -->

I might come back and do an update later on my impressions after having had it
for a bit longer. Feel free to ask me anything if you have something specific in
mind or anything you'd like me to test out!

> I'm going to compare the Deck to the Nintendo Switch from time to time,
_not_ because they are somehow a like-to-like comparison (they are not), but
because a lot of people have a Switch and it can serve as a familiar reference
point.

# What's in the box?

The Deck arrives in a slim box which contains the case (with the Deck inside)
and a charging cable. The charging cable isn't too exciting, a USB-C cable
attached to a power brick. At first glance I kind of wished the outlet prongs
would fold in for a slightly slimmer travel size (Apple laptop chargers have
spoiled me) but I quickly got over my disappointment.

The case itself is pretty sturdy. I wouldn't drop it down the stairs or anything
like that, but the Deck will be safe in a backpack or with your luggage. What I
also found kinda cool was that the case came locked with a Valve branded zipper
lock that I had to cut through. I wasn't particularly worried about a
supply-chain attack on my Deck during transit, but feels neat to imagine no one
has seen/tampered with my unit since it came off the factory.

The case also has a little recess in the back with an elastic band over it.
Perhaps it's a slot to fit the charging cable, because the inside of the case
fits the Deck precisely with no space to spare. I'm a bit skeptical if the
charger can securely remain held by the elastic band, but I also haven't tried
throwing it a backpack to test, so your mileage may vary...

# Size and Feel

The first thing that struck me about the Deck is just how BIG it is. I knew it
was way bigger than a Switch, but it was something else to see in person. The
case is pretty much the same size as both halves of my ZSA Moonlander next to
each other (without the wrist guards, of course). Despite this first impression
(and my initial skepticism about the button layout), it feels incredibly
comfortable in my hands. Definitely heavier than the Switch (the Deck is about
twice as heavy as the Switch as per their weight specs) but still comfortable to
hold and play in my lap.

{{ figure(

  caption="A Switch inside the case for scale.",
  alt="A Nintendo Switch sits inside the Deck's case with space to spare"
) }}

The button layout feels great and is within easy reach from the thumb sticks. I
also found that I _really_ liked the buttons on the back of the Deck, especially
since I haven't used or seen any (mainstream) controllers actually support that
layout. Basically you get four extra keys to use with the rest of your fingers
(which usually don't do anything on other controllers), which makes it possible
to play games without even lifting your right thumb from the joystick.

I imagine that most adult hands would feel comfortable on the Deck. Even hands
on the smaller size _should_ be able to hold it comfortably. For example, I
position my middle and ring fingers on the back buttons, but I could easily
shift my hand further up (so that my ring and pinkie fingers are on the buttons)
without having to stretch to reach them. Younger children would probably
struggle a bit though, especially since the joystick do have a bit of travel
to them; the Switch controllers might be a better fit for them.

# Install

I immediately updated the Deck after the initial boot. It took about five
minutes to download and do the update (fun fact, the initial build flashed on
the unit was from November 2021 but after the update it skipped straight to
April 2022). I somehow expected that to just update the Steam client and then
require updating the OS afterwards, but no, that was all of it!

Next was signing into my Steam account, which was a bit painful given that I use
a very long and complicated password stored in my password manager and I clearly
mistyped something on my first attempt. I did not consider going to desktop mode
(and installing my password manager) at this step, so I'm not sure if the
installer would have prevented me from trying or not.

I did notice during my initial login that the keyboard had an emoji button in
the corner. Tapping on it greeted me with a JavaScript error of all things, and
I couldn't help but chuckle to myself. It's okay, Valve, fonts on Linux _are_
hard.

{{ figure(
  src="emoji_error.jpg",
  alt="A JavaScript error is shown on the screen: TypeError: Cannot read property 'GetServerRTime32' of undefined"
) }}

Jokes aside, the problem immediately went away after I manually rebooted (the
installer rebooted on its own when completing, but clearly it wasn't enough). My
recommendation is to just manually reboot after the install is done lest other
paper cuts bite you (actually the reason why I switched to using the touch
screen to type in my password was because hitting up on the controller stick
would end up closing the keyboard, another bug which resolved itself after
rebooting).

> ## Post Install
> Somehow I found Valve's _Aperture Desk Job_ when Steam opened up. It's basically
a _Portal_-universe-themed little tech demo which shows off the Deck's inputs
(and has you practice summoning and using the keyboard among other things). It
was a fun way to warm up with the controls so check it out!

# Screen and Disk Size

I got the 256GB SSD model which does not come with the "premium anti-glare
etched glass". The screen is awesome, given it's size, resolution, and color, I
have absolutely no complaints. It is pretty shiny and you can definitely see a
reflection when taking photos of it. But other than that I don't plan on playing
in the sun so I don't anticipate it would be a huge problem for me.

I partly regret not ordering the biggest model which would double the storage
capacity for another 120 bucks (not to mention I've heard the anti-glare glass
is also great). Especially since games these days tend to average around 10 gigs
meaning as time goes on the hard drive can only fit so many games at a time (and
I'm not even mentioning the 50+ gig monstrosities some AAA studios are putting
out these days). That said, the Deck's SSD is apparently user serviceable, not
to mention the SD card slot can really expand the memory, so I'm not too
worried. I'm just happy to have one in hand given all the supply chain shortages
hitting the world right now.

# Thermals

Let's talk about the thermals and cooling on the Deck. I won't sugar coat it,
the fan is audible when it kicks in. If you are sitting in a quiet room trying
to read, for example, you will hear it. That said, the audio speakers are more
than enough to overcome it and I immediately forgot about it after focusing on
the game in front of me. I imagine gaming with headphones would drown the noise
out completely (for me at least).

There _is_ a reason why the fan is so strong, as you can feel the stream of heat
coming straight out of the Deck when playing a game. My first gaming session was
about an hour while I was also charging the battery. By the end of it, the
middle-top of the Deck felt pretty warm (the back surface that is, not just the
air coming out of it) which is where the heat sink must be. The hand grips are
incredibly far away, though, and since it vents upwards I don't have any
concerns about temperature related discomfort while playing in my lap.

# Battery Life

I've yet to drain the battery fully. Based on my own estimates and those of
others, you should be able to get three to four hours of play time from a full
charge, though it will depend on how performance intensive the game is. For what
it's worth, I played about an hour of _Portal 2_ and the battery went down to
75% from starting at a full charge. I'm pretty happy with the prospect of
getting four hours out of the Deck's specs. There might be ways to squeeze out
extra battery life (like capping frame rate, turning down graphics and
brightness settings) but I'm fine traveling with a charger.

# Controller Customization

I'm really impressed with the amount of customization you can do of the controls
on the Deck. Anything including the joystick dead zones and sensitivity, along
with binding buttons to arbitrary inputs, as well as specific inputs to enable
gyro controls. For games that don't support controller inputs, the Deck can
instead send key codes which achieve the same outcome even without formal
controller support!

What's also cool is that it supports _layers_ where the button bindings can be
changed based on having another button pressed or held. It's very similar to
layers on programmable keyboards, for those of you who are familiar with them.

Controller layouts can be defined/customized per-game, and you can even share
and download configurations with others (I guess Steam has supported this for a
while around their Steam Controller integration, but it was the first time I
came across it).

# The Gyroscope

I have very mixed feelings about the gyroscope feature on the Deck.

Basically the way it works is you can tilt the body of the Deck and use that as
an input source. What that is translated to is entirely configurable, it could
be the camera controls, or movement controls, or whatever else the game may
support. The gyro also isn't constantly on, you can configure how it is
triggered (by default resting a thumb on the right joystick or right track pad,
but it can also be configured to activate with holding a different button).

The controls also feel _unintuitively intuitive_: logically it makes sense how
they are implemented but intuitively I struggled for a while. Perhaps I just
need more practice.

Normally I _hate_ gyro controls: I personally find the Switch's gyro controls a
gimmick in both _Mario Kart 8_ and _Breath of the Wild_ and disabled them the
first opportunity. On the Deck, however, I find them to work pretty well,
especially since they give really precise control with very minimal movement
(which is a huge achievement given the Deck's hefty size). Depending on joy
stick's dead zones and how sluggish/imprecise the game handles with the joy
stick inputs (like it is the case for _Portal 2_), I found that I can quickly
and precisely do minor aim correction without over or undershooting as I would
with the joystick (but for macro aim correction the joystick would work fine).

What put me off about actually _using_ the gyro in-game was that nothing
actually stops you from sending _both_ gyro and joystick controls _at the same
time_. The default settings also have the gyro running when resting a thumb on
the right joystick (i.e. how I imagine most people operate the joystick) which
made me feel very disoriented with unexpected inputs. Perhaps with more training
and the right sensitivity configuration it could make for interesting control
schemes, but I'm going to avoid it for the time being.

# Desktop Mode

Desktop Mode allows you to drop straight into a KDE Plasma session and use it
just like you would on a desktop install. The track pad makes for a good mouse
cursor to click around and launch stuff. The touchscreen also works, but isn't
calibrated for use with a finger.

I would drop any delusions about meaningfully using Desktop Mode without having
at least a keyboard attached to it (unless you are _really_ desperate to watch a
YouTube video or something). You can summon the keyboard in a pinch (default
binding is `STEAM + X`), but it takes up half the screen and locks you out of
mouse inputs on the other half until you close it. Oh and the keyboard has most
of the keys you'd need to type in some login credentials, but it's missing stuff
like `Ctrl` or `Esc` so even masochists will have a difficult time trying to get
vim working without a physical keyboard.

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I have access to the actual desktop if I need to
install something or launch a game outside of Steam. But I'm not going to fault
Valve for not making _operating a Linux desktop environment easy with a
controller_.

# Conclusion

Congratulations to Valve on the Deck launch, they've done an awesome job
designing it! Overall I'm really happy with what it has to offer. I'm also
really pleased that it lives up to the promise of being a handheld computer
which gives the user power to do with it as they wish.

The few criticisms I have are all temporary: UX glitches will eventually be
fixed, game compatibility will improve with time, and storage expansion is one
SD card purchase away. As for the criticisms which cannot be changed, like
battery life or fan noise, I know I can live with them; I'm sure the design
choices leading up to them were intentionally picked to improve the end result.

For those still waiting to receive their own Deck: it's worth the wait!
